# App Title: Follow-Me

### Description:<br>
#### This is a social media app where you can share your ideas, thoughts, feelings etc. with those who choose to follow you. It's an easy way to stay connected with other people anywhere in the world. There will be features to update your status with whatever information you woud like to share and then your followers will have the freedom to like, comment, and/or share your post with others. My goal is to have this app fully functional and user friendly for everyone.

### Wireframes: <br>
My home page will incude a list of users who have joined the platform with links to follow them and see their posts, as well as create a new user. The individual user page will include posts made by that user and the add a user page will allow for creating an entirely new user to add to the home page. The screen will be optimized for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones to display the same information is compatible layouts.

### API: <br>
#### Airtable will house data for all the users of the app and include 4 main components to a user's post which are username, profile image, status update, and date posted. Here's a sample data pull from my Airtable.

### MVP: <br>
* Home page with list of users currently on the platform and each user will have clickable link that takes you to their individual page. 
* Home page will also have a button to add a new user to the site. 
* Get data from airtable to populate profile picture, bio, username, and status post.
* Forms in individual pages will allow for new posts and edits/deletes to existing posts.
     


### Post-MVP: <br>
* Add a search bar on the main page that allows users to search for other accounts which is helpful as the platform grows. 
* Add an invite button for each user that generates a sharable link to follow that user. 
* Allow individual users to post additional statuses and edit their posted statuses.
* Add a counter next to likes button that updates when user likes post.

### SWOT Analysis: <br> 

#### Strengths:
I understand the concept of CRUD and I'm looking forward to putting that understanding to the test with this project. I feel like I have a clear vision of what I would like my project to look like and how I want it to flow so that will make it easier for me when I start connecting the pieces.

#### Weaknesses:
There are certain aspects of the site that I am visualizing but I am not sure how to accomplish them right now. Things like preventing other users from being able to delete data that was not posted by them. It's difgficult for me to over look those things in the scope of this project so I will need to avoid going down a rabbit hole researching how that process works. 

#### Opportunities:
I am looking forward to this project giving me the opportunity to take what I've learned and use that to transfer what I want my app to look and perform like into the browser. The app will give me an opportunity to recap everything we have learned and if time permits, start to look into other features I can incorporate into the app.

#### Threats:
Sometimes I struggle in silence because I have a bad habbit of refusing to lose and I also always think there is value in the struggle when I'm able to resolve it and understand the why behind everything. I have to avoid that with this project in the interest of hitting my deliverables. I need to make sure I am taking advantage of my resources like my team lead and my fellow teammates to help me get unstuck when I need it.
